Research Strategy
--------------  
The research methods for Vote.usa.gov are detailed in the [Research Strategy](https://github.com/18F/vote-gov-ux/blob/master/Background%20and%20Process/Research%20Strategy.md) document. This lays out how the team will collaborate with end users to ensure that any major design decisions are validated by user feedback and follow a user centric approach.


Research Plan Template
-------------
The team will use a [Research Plan](https://github.com/18F/vote-gov-ux/blob/master/Background%20and%20Process/research-plan-template.md) to guide and plan all research efforts conducted by the team. These plans can also be used by stakeholders to gain an understanding on what research methods were used, what users were involved, and what topics were discussed during the research efforts.

User Profiles  
-------------  
During the kickoff efforts of developing Vote.usa.gov, the team crafted a series of [User Profiles](https://github.com/18F/vote-gov-ux/blob/master/Background%20and%20Process/User%20Profiles/Votingarchetypes.md) that represent the people most likely to interact with the website. These profiles focus on the general demographics and behavioral patterns exhibited by our end users.
